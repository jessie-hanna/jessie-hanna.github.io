                As I look back on this journey, I'm filled with a sense of pride and accomplishment. It's been an incredible ride, and I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity to share it with all of you. Most of you came in as strangers but you left as friends. I'll cherish those friendships forever. I am closing this chapter for my family and I. It's a new beginning, and I'm excited to see what the future holds. You can find me on Facebook if you'd like to stay connected. I would love that. I just want to say THANK YOU to everyone who has supported me and helped me on this journey. Your support has been my driving force, my motivation, and my inspiration. I couldn't have made it without you. I’m sure gonna miss all your smiling faces!
